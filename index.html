        <h1>Hello, You!</h1>
        <p class="presentation">
          My name is Sara, and I'm a Motion Designer seeking for <span class="newAdventures"> new adventures. </span> 
        </p>
        <p class="theLetter">
          While looking for job opportunities here in the Netherlands, I stumbled across HTLM and CSS, which brought back a lot of memories from when I was a teenager and risked editing my blog templates. Needless to say that I fell in love again, and I realized that if I combined it with my skills as a Motion Designer, I'd go much further and have a lot to offer.
<br />
Sure, motion design catches my eye and made it possible for me to work with big brands and challenging projects. But now I'm ready for new adventures.
<br />
When I found this trainee opportunity, I got excited as I knew I could learn from experienced people and evolve as a Developer.
<br />
Rest assured that if you choose me you will have someone who's fully energetic and excited.
